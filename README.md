A small javascript graph library that generates charts using the html canvas tag. This library is based on the graphs generated by many of the mathematics tools such as Matlab, Mathematica, etc.

**Usage**

Download the [library source code](https://github.com/dhuertas/graph.js/tarball/master) and include the javascript file in your html.

```
<script src="js/graph.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

And you are done!
